# spannbeton.js

## ”we help you build things“

``spannbeton.js`` is the newest JavaScript framework to help you build
your things.  While it's primarily designed for big projects, you can
also use it for smaller ones.

These are our main features:

* following the **SOLID** principles, of course

* we really **do** webscale

* easy to **implement**

* **debugged**
